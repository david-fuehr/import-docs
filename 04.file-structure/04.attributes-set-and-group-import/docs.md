### CSV File Structure

By default, the Attribute Set + Group Import expects a CSV file with the following defaults

* UTF-8 encoding
* Date format is n/d/y, g:i A
* Values delimiter is a comma (,)
* Multiple value delimiter is a pipe (|)
* Text values are enclosed with double apostrophes (")
* Special chars are escaped with a backslash (\)

> Columns that doesn't contain a value are ignored by default. This means, it is **NOT** possible to delete or override an existing value with an empty value. To delete an existing value, the whole attribute set/group has to be removed by running an import with the `delete` operation. After that, the attribute set/group with the new values can be imported by running an `add-update` operation. This default behaviour can be changed with the `clean-up-empty-columns` parameter in the particular subject.

The CSV file with the attributes for the Magento 2 CE/EE consists of the following columns, whereas each attribute set can have multipe attribute groups
