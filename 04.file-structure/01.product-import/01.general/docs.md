The Magento standard CSV format provides a feature called comoplex data which allows some kind of simple serialization e. g. to have list of additional attributes within one column.

General things that are **NOT** allowed

* Attribute code **MUST NOT** contain any special chars (only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ are allowed)
* Attribute option values for the admin store **MUST NOT** contain a comma (,)
