To install the Magnento 2 Import Framework, composer is necessary. The framework itself is a set of components that provide import functionality for Magento 2. This repository, based on Symfony Console, uses the the package [M2IF](https://github.com/techdivision/import) and provides a command line tool with import functionality for Magento 2 standard CSV files.

> Up from M2IF version 3.6.0 can be used for Magento 2.2.x as well as 2.3.x!
