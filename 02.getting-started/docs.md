To install the Magnento 2 Import Framework, composer is necessary. The framework itself is a set of components that provide import functionality for Magento 2. This repository, based on Symfony Console, uses the the package [M2IF](https://github.com/techdivision/import) and provides a command line tool with import functionality for Magento 2 standard CSV files.

> The following description assumes that the target system for the import is Magento 2.3.x that is supported by the M2IF 3.x versions. For Magento 2.2.x M2IF version 2.2.x **HAS** to be used.
