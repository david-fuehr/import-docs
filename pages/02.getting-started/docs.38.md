!! ATTENTION: Up from version 3.8.0 the structure how the configugration will be processed has been changed. Your old configuration files can **NOT** be processed anymore and you've to customize your configuration when you switch from 3.7.x to 3.8.x.

To install the Magnento 2 Import Framework, composer is necessary. The framework itself is a set of components that provide import functionality for Magento 2. This repository, based on Symfony Console, uses the the package [M2IF](https://github.com/techdivision/import) and provides a command line tool with import functionality for Magento 2 standard CSV files.

Before you start, keep in mind, that we've prepared a complete set of sample data for you. The sample data contains attribute-sets, attributes, categories as well as products and is based on the Magento 2 sample data. Please have a look at our [sample data repository](https://github.com/techdivision/import-sample-data), when you are going to test M2IF or if you want to get an idea, how the CSV files have to look like.

> Up from M2IF version 3.6.0 can be used for Magento 2.2.x as well as 2.3.x!
